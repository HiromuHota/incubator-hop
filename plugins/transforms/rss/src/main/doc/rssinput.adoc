== Notes on Error Handling

When error handling is turned on for the pipeline that includes this transform, the full exception message, the field number on which the error occurred, and one or more of the following codes will be sent in an error row to the error stream:

* UnknownError: an unexpected error. Check the "Error description" field for more details.
* XMLError: typically this means that the specified file is not XML.
* FileNotFound: an HTTP 404 error.
* UnknownHost: means that the domain name cannot be resolved; may be caused by network outage.
* TransferError: any non-404 HTTP server error code (401, 403, 500, 502, etc.) can cause this.
* BadURL: means that the URL cannot be understood. It may be missing a protocol or use an unrecognized protocol.
* BadRSSFormat: typically means that the file is valid XML, but is not a supported RSS or Atom doc type.

Note: To see the full stack trace from a handled error, turn on detailed logging.
